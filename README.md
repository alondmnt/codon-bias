# codon-bias

This package provides analysis tools for genomic sequences, focusing on protein coding regions, translation efficiency and synonymous mutations. These include implementations of popular models from the past 3 decades of codon usage study, such as:

- Frequency of Optimal Codons (FOP)
- Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU)
- Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)
- Effective Number of Codons (ENC)
- tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI)
- Relative Codon Bias Score (RCBS)
- Directional Codon Bias Score (DCBS)
- Codon Usage Frequency Similarity (CUFS)

## installation

```
pip install codon-bias
```
